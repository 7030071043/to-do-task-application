javascript functioning knowledge

1.Get the Task from Input:

- The function starts by retrieving the value entered in the text input field (where the user types the task) and stores it in the task variable.
It also removes any extra spaces before and after the task (using trim()).

2.Check if Task is Empty:

- If the user hasn't typed anything (the input is empty), it displays an alert message (Please enter a task) and stops the function from continuing.

3.Create a New Task Item:

- A new div element is created (taskItem) to represent the entire task. This is like a container for the task text and buttons.
The getTaskClass(task) function is called to assign a specific style class (e.g., for urgent, completed, or normal tasks) based on the content of the task.

4.Create the Task Text:

- A span element is created to hold the actual task text that the user entered.
The taskText gets the text of the task (what the user typed in) and is then added to the task item.

5.Create Edit Button:

- A button labeled "Edit" is created (editButton).
When the user clicks this button, the edit_task(taskText) function is called, which allows the user to edit the task.

6.Create Delete Button:

- A button labeled "Delete" is also created (deleteButton).
When the user clicks this button, the delete_task(taskItem) function is called, which removes the task from the list.

7.Add Everything to the Task Item:

- The task text (taskText), the "Edit" button, and the "Delete" button are added (appended) inside the task item (taskItem).

8. Display the Task:

- The newly created task item is added to the task-list1 element (which is a container for all the tasks).
9.Clear the Input Field:

-After adding the task, the input field is cleared so the user can type a new task.

Summary:
This function creates a new task with an "Edit" and "Delete" button and displays it in the task list. 
The user can edit the task by clicking "Edit" or remove the task by clicking "Delete." 
After submitting a task, the input field is cleared to prepare for the next task.
